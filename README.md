# Mashup project

This project is open-ended!  Requirements:

* Build a site that uses data from at least one external API in an interesting way.
* Replace this README with a description of the project.
* You are welcome to use any 3rd-party libraries/frameworks – just load them from a CDN (e.g. [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com)), or put them under the [`vendor/`](vendor/) folder.

The JS code should be **non-trivial**.  That being said... start simple!  No server-side coding is required, but feel free to create a backend in whatever language if you like, if you need one.

* [AJAX demos](https://github.com/advanced-js/deck/tree/gh-pages/demos/ajax)
* [list of API suggestions](https://gist.github.com/afeld/4952991)
* [inspiration?](http://www.programmableweb.com/mashups)
